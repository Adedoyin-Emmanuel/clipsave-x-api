# Clipsave X API ðŸš€

This is a simple API to test downloading Twitter videos and pictures. I tried doing it from NextJS but it wasn't working. I was getting a 403 error. So I will host this to render and hopefully the issue will be fixed. One can only hope savvy.

Humm, the issue is not with NextJS. The issue is with twitter API. Unless i subscribe to pro, I can't use that endpoint in production. Sad stuff. This method works only on localhost. I've to find an alternative right here, right now
